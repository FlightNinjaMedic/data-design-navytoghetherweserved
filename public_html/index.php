				Name: Devil Bill
			</p>
			<p>
			Age: 50
			</p>

				<p>
			     Profession: Bill is a hard core retired marine looking to stay in touch with all current or former Devil Doc's based on common duty stations.
				</p>

			<p>
				Technology: Extremely technologically challenged, Was a marine who's career time was totally spent in an infantry unit. Served five back to back tours in Iraq and two more in Afghanistan. Owns a Motorola Razor flip phone and has no interest in ever owning a smart phone.
			</p>
			<p>
				Attitude and Behaviors: Now retired, Bill has an outstanding attitude towards life, loves to fish and camp. Once a month he gets toghether with other retired members of the armed forces at Cabezon Wounded Warrior Haven for some real life war games. As Bill puts it: "You can take Bill out of the marines, but you will never take the marine out of Bill"
			</p>
			<p>
				Frustrations and Needs:  Like a large percentage of military veterans, Bill suffers from PTSD and other injuries, too many to list.  Bill is a member of the local VFW and even though this has been the primary way he interacts with friends, he is sick and tired of the non-stop beer drinking. Bill wishes there was a better way to stay in touch with friends that served with him.

				<p>
					Bill has registered with Navy Toghether We Served and since reconnected with a number of friends. Hard to believe but he has expressed a interest in a smart phone so that he can stay in touch with his friends while on the go.
